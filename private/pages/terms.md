We may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our [Acceptable Use Policy](/doc/Acceptable-use-p9xW08xotk7nc4PmGSLeZ). That said, we have no obligation to do so.

## 3. Software in Our Service

Some of our Service allow you to download client software (the “**Software**”), this Software may update automatically on your device once a new version or features become available to you.

Tundar gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software as part of the Service.

You agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Service, attempt to do so or assist anyone in doing so, unless local laws prohibit those restrictions.

## 4. Beta Services

We sometimes release products and features that we are still testing and evaluating. Those services have been marked as beta (or words or phrases with similar meaning) and may not be as reliable as Tundar’s other Service, so please bear that in mind.

## 5. Third Party Applications

If you elect to utilize any third party application in connection with your use of the Service, by doing so you are consenting to your Content being shared with such third party application. To understand how such third party application provider utilizes your Content and other information, you should review their privacy policy.

## 6. Termination

You can choose to stop using our Service at will. We also reserve the right to suspend or end the Service at any time at our discretion and without notice. We may also terminate or suspend your access to the Service at any time if you are not complying with these Terms or our [Acceptable Use Policy](/doc/Acceptable-use-p9xW08xotk7nc4PmGSLeZ) or if you are using the Service in a manner that we believe may cause us financial or legal liability.

## 7. Security

We take security very seriously. We use industry standard technical and organizational security that are designed to protect the integrity of your Content and to guard against unauthorized or unlawful access to, use of, or processing of such Content.

We make it a priority to be transparent in how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our website and software. Please see our [Privacy Policy](/doc/Privacy-policy-Rj5tfQx15awgUf4nyt8tY) for more details.

## 8. Copyright

We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.

## 9. Paid Accounts

You may choose our free account or paid account (the “**Paid Account**”) depending on your need. You can upgrade from free account to Paid Account at any time by following instructions on our pricing page (“**Pricing**”). All prices shown on Pricing are inclusive of any applicable sales taxes, levies, value-added taxes, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you are responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties.

We will automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you do not pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or reduce your storage to free space levels.

When a free trial of Paid Account is offered, you will have access to all Paid Account features. After the free trial period, if you choose not to upgrade to Paid Account, features available to you will be limited to free account. 

You can cancel your Paid Account at any time. Refunds are only issued if required by law. For example, users living in the European Union have the right to cancel their Paid Account subscriptions within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading to or renewing a Paid Account.

We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address associated with your account.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL TUNDAR, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE, WHETHER OR NOT TUNDAR HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. 

OTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW, WE LIMIT OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO THE SERVICE TO THE GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU'VE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE PLAN WITH TUNDAR.

## 11. Dispute Resolution

11.1. **Informal Efforts.** We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Tundar, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute-notice@tundar.be. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days of submission, you or Tundar may bring a formal proceeding.

11.2. **Judicial forum for disputes.** You and Tundar agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Service will be brought in the Arbitration Court of Moscow district, Russian Federation. Both you and Tundar consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a country (for example, a European Union member state) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesn't affect those requirements.

## 12. Governing Law

These Terms will be governed by the law of the Russian Federation except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn't override those laws.

## 13. Entire Agreement

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Tundar with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third-party beneficiary rights.

## 14. Assignment, Severability, Waiver

Tundar's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Tundar may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Service.

## 15. Notices

We may provide you with legal notices and notices related to your account via email using the email address associated with your account. We may provide you with other marketing or business-related information, including information about Service updates or changes via email.
