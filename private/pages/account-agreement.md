This Tundar’s Account Agreement (the "Agreement") is between TUNDAR, LLC (the “Tundar“) and the organisation agreeing to these terms ("Customer”). This Agreement governs Customer’s access to and use of Tundar’s services (the “Service”) and its associated applications, website and Beta Services. By clicking "I agree", signing your contract for the Service or using the Service, you agree to this Agreement. If you are agreeing to this Agreement, you are agreeing on behalf of that organisation and you must have the authority to bind that organisation to these terms, otherwise, you must not sign up for the Service.

This Agreement, in combination with Tundar’s general [Terms of Service](/doc/Terms-of-Service-0ZQroJTiZC5hylhwWhqkv), [Privacy Policy](/doc/Privacy-policy-Rj5tfQx15awgUf4nyt8tY) and [Acceptable Use Policy](/doc/Acceptable-use-p9xW08xotk7nc4PmGSLeZ) set forth the terms and conditions under which Tundar makes the Service available to you. The Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and Acceptable Use Policy are an integral part of this Account Agreement.

## 1. Service and Software

This Agreement governs access to, and use of, the Service and Software. The Customer and users under Customer’s account (the “End Users”) may access and use the Service in accordance with this Agreement and Tundar’s [Acceptable Use Policy](/doc/Acceptable-use-p9xW08xotk7nc4PmGSLeZ). Tundar may update or modify the Service from time to time. If Tundar changes the Service in a manner that materially reduces their functionality, Tundar will notify the Customer at the email address associated with the account, and the Customer may provide notice within thirty (30) days of the change to terminate the Agreement. 

Tundar will use industry standard technical and organisational security measures to transfer, store and process Customer Data that are designed to protect the integrity of Customer Data and guard against the unauthorised or unlawful access to, use of and processing of Customer Data.

We may provide certain downloadable Software for use in connection with the Service. This Software is updated automatically and, if such Software is designed for use on a mobile device, then a compatible mobile device is required for use. Tundar hereby grants to the Customer during the Term a limited non-exclusive licence to use the Software solely in connection with the Service and in accordance with this Agreement.

## 2. Customer Obligations

2.1. **Customer Administration of the Service.** The Customer may specify End Users as Administrators via the admin console. Administrators have the ability to access, monitor, use, export and disclose all content posted by End Users. The Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of passwords and Admin Accounts, and managing access to Admin Accounts. Tundar’s responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the Service for the Customer.

2.2. **End User Conduct.** The Customer is responsible for use of the Service by its End Users and for their compliance with Tundar’s [Acceptable Use Policy](/doc/Acceptable-use-p9xW08xotk7nc4PmGSLeZ). The Customer will also (a) prevent unauthorised use of the Service by its End Users and terminate any unauthorised use of or access to the Service and (b) ensure that it does not allow any person under the age of 13 to use the Service.

2.4. **Third Party Services and Integrations.** If the Customer uses any third-party services or applications, such as a service that uses a Tundar API, with the Service: (a) Tundar will not be responsible for any act or omission on the part of such third party or its service; and (b) Tundar does not warrant or support any services provided by the third party.

## 3. Third-party Requests

3.1. **Customer Responsibility*****.*** The Customer is responsible for responding to Third-party Requests via its own access to information. The Customer will seek to obtain information required to respond to Third-party Requests and will contact Tundar only if it cannot obtain such information despite diligent efforts.

If the Customer fails to respond promptly to any Third-party Requests, Tundar may, but will not be obligated to do so.

## 4. Payment

The Customer will pay Tundar all applicable Fees for the Service in the currency indicated on the Order Form. The Customer will pay all applicable fees when due and, if such fees are being paid via credit card or other electronic means, the Customer authorizes Tundar to charge such fees using Customer’s selected payment method. Fees are non-refundable except as required by law or as otherwise specifically permitted in this Agreement.

The Customer accounts are set to auto-renew and Tundar may automatically charge Customer for such renewal on or after the renewal date associated with the Customer’s account unless the Customer has cancelled the Service prior to its renewal date. Tundar may suspend or terminate the Service if Fees are overdue. Tundar may revise Service rates by providing the Customer at least thirty (30) days notice prior to the next charge. The Customer is responsible for providing complete and accurate billing information to Tundar.

The Customer is responsible for all taxes (excluding taxes on Tundar’s net income). Tundar will charge Taxes when required to do so. 

If the Customer requires the use of a purchase order or purchase order number, the Customer (a) must provide the purchase order number at the time of purchase; and (b) agrees that, except for any amendments to this Agreement that are clearly marked as such on the face of the Purchase Order, any terms and conditions on a Customer purchase order that conflict with this Agreement will not apply and are null and void.

## 5. Intellectual Property Rights

5.1. **Limited Permission.** The Customer grants to Tundar a limited, non-exclusive and non-transferrable (except in connection with the sale or transfer of its business) license to access, process, use, reproduce, copy, adapt, publish, display and transmit the Customer Data that is reasonably necessary for Tundar to provide the Service. This limited permission also extends to Sub-contractors or Sub-processors.

Tundar may also share and publish aggregate, anonymized data about the use of the Service by our customers.

## 6. Suspension

Tundar may request that Customer suspend the account of any End User who: (a) violates this Agreement or Tundar’s [Acceptable Use Policy](/doc/Acceptable-use-p9xW08xotk7nc4PmGSLeZ); or (b) uses the Service in a manner that Tundar reasonably believes may cause it liability, a disruption to others’ use of the Service, or cause a security risk for Tundar. If the Customer fails to suspend or terminate the End User account promptly, Tundar reserves the right to do so.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, if there is a Security Emergency, Tundar may suspend use of the Service automatically and will make commercially reasonable efforts to narrowly tailor the suspension as needed to prevent or terminate the Security Emergency.
